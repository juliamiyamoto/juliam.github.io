    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m an undergraduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Creative Technology and Design, with a minor in Engineering Management. I am from Los Angeles,where I’ve grown up closely connected to the ocean, an environment that has shaped both my personal values and professional experience through years of ocean lifeguarding and youth instruction. I have a strong passion for travel and exploring different cultures, especially through food, which I believe is one of the most meaningful ways to understand people and places. Whether I’m working on creative projects, ensuring public safety, or collaborating with a team, I bring curiosity, adaptability, and a calm, focused mindset. I’m seeking opportunities that combine creativity, impact, and purpose—roles where I can contribute to something meaningful while continuing to grow professionally and personally. I’m motivated by work that aligns with my passions, values community, and encourages exploration both locally and globally.</p>
